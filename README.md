See the HTML files for further details (I have also added a PDF version since the HTML is too large to be displayed without you downloading it yourself (1.8MB). Note that the first page of the PDF is blank, so you need to scroll down). You can download the animated predictions as an mp4 file.

I currently predict an upper-case estimate of 444 new cases on the island of Ireland today, 26/03/20.
